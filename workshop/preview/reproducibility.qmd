# Reproducibility

## Goal
This session aims to highlight the importance of reproducibility in AI-driven Arctic research. Participants will learn about the challenges and best practices for ensuring that AI models and their results can be reproduced by other researchers, a cornerstone for building trust and advancing the field. The discussion will cover strategies for documenting experiments, sharing data and code, and using version control systems.

## Outline 
- The Reproducibility Checklist 
- Sharing Code
- Model Repositories
- Version Control
- LEGO Activity
