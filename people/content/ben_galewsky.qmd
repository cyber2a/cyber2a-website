After working for several years as an IT Consultant in industry I've happily switched
to a career in research software engineering, which I think of as IT Consulting for Science! I'm currently a Senior Research Software Engineer at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign. I work with researchers to understand their needs and design software solutions to help advance their research goals. I'm particularly intersted in data management and machine learning operations.
