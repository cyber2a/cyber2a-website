At NCEAS, I lead an environmental data science program focused on enabling individual researchers and teams to achieve more impactful outcomes through better analysis, modeling, visualization, and data management. With a career arc traversing both academia and the commercial software industry, I've delivered data-driven insights and helped build new data/analytics infrastructure across diverse application domains, and am especially passionate about expanding data science literacy and expertise in the practitioner community.
