I'm a Research Software Engineer at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications(NCSA) at University of Illinois Urbana Champaign. My primary interests are in the field of ML/AI with a focus in NLP. Having a background in Computer Science and Wireless communication, I try to utilize the knowledge gained across multiple verticals to deliver better solutions and software. At NCSA, I work on multiple projects ranging from implementing LLM agents for RNA Sequencing tasks to development of a cloud native data management framework. Outside of work, I like badminton, swimming, traveling, painting and attending concerts.
